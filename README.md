# Chatroom-Application

This application is a chatting application made using socket.io. The application opens up with a UI that asks the user to put a username and a chatroom name. Two users with the same username cannot exist in the same room and I used validation to ensure that it would never happen. The users are stored inside an array instead of a database as it is a very temporary process. The application uses sockets to ensure that real time communication could happen between different users on the same server. A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between which the communication take place.Socket are generally employed in client server applications. The server creates a socket, attaches it to a network port addresses then waits for the client to contact it. The client creates a socket and then attempts to connect to the server socket. When the connection is established, transfer of data takes place.
